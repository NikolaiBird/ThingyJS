Welcome to ThingyJS
========

ThingyJS is a JavaScript framework for data storage, editing, presentation and sharing.

Currently it is in hot development.

Each unit of data is called a thingy. A thingy can be a shoe size, an eye colour, an html document, a markdown file, a password, a script, a contact, a formula, a weight, an age, a code snippet, a phone number, a statistic... just about anything as long as it can be saved as a string.

Using the power of JavaScript you can create advanced filtering to find and maatch one or many thingies that are then presented to you on screen.

A number of thingies can be combined to create an entire page of information from simple lists to an entire website.

The perfect use is as a note taking app in which you can create advanced lists based on tags and naming conventions.
